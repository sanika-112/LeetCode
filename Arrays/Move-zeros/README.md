283. Move Zeroes

Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.
Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0]
Output: [0]
 
Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 104
-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1

Solution Approach ->
1.Two pointers :
  Use i and j ,i for current element and j for next non-zero element.
  Time Complexity : O(n)
  Space Complexity : O(1)

2.First move non-zeros and then zeros.
  Time Complexity : O(n)
  Space Complexity : O(1)
